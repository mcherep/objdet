# Object Detection in Tensorflow

A collection of functions that allow to perform object detection using any model in Tensorflow. The goal is to be able to integrate the [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) easily in other projects, allowing transfer learning and training in Google Colab. In order to use it you should have your own model or choose one from the [Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md), and your data in the given format below.
